# MEREDITH WEB APP
Meredith is a landing page generator for nonprofits to build their donation pages. Mobile focused, it follows the "story" type design of snapchat/instagram. 

The simplicity of the design allows for nonprofits to easily provide creative assets in an easy to understand format: "make an instagram story about why someone should donate...". 

The backend, found here: https://github.com/whynotearth/Meredith is built on .net core.
